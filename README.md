# Task-02: Image Encryption using Pixel Manipulation

This project is part of my cybersecurity internship.

## Description
A simple Python-based image encryption tool that modifies pixel values using a numeric key.
The same key is used to decrypt the image and restore the original image.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pillow (PIL)

## How to Run
1. Place an image named input.png in the folder
2. Run: python image_encrypt.py
3. Run: python image_decrypt.py using the same key

## Note
This project is created strictly for educational purposes.
